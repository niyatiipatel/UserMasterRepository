# UserMasterRepository

Problem Statement :
As user should be able to register into a system with basic personal details. User can add multiple addresses. User should be able to update user information or save if user does not exist in the system. User should be able to get list of all users, to search a user by email, to edit address of the user and to delete user.

Summary of the application:
“User Master” is a spring-boot web application, which is used to manage the details of users along with multiple addresses. The application creates the required User entity along with the relationship with Address entity. There are several REST API calls to fulfil the problem statement. All the API(s) are well constructed and tested using JUnit API. The application is docker containerized for Spring Boot and Database (Instructions to start a docker container and testing APIs through POSTMAN are given below). An architectural diagram to demonstrate the workflow has also been attached.

Tools and Technologies:
●	IDE - Spring Tool Suite 4.12.0 Release
●	Database - PostgreSQL 14.0
●	Technology - JavaSE-11, Spring Boot Framework 2.5.5
●	Data Model - JPA/Hibernate
●	Docker Engine v20.10.8

Instructions to set up connection string
URL = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/backend_test
Username = postgres
Password = test
